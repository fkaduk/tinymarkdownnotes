- this repo uses uv and flask
- when running pytest through the Bash tool, exit code 120 may occur due to stream flushing issues in the tool's output capture mechanism, but this doesn't indicate actual test failures (running `uv run pytest` directly in a shell returns exit code 0)
- avoid code comments
- avoid trailing . in prose
- this project uses caddy
- be minimal and concise in your prose
